# NetflixComponent


My component was developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap. As I was saying to Cesar Chaparro, I don't use the Vue framework because I haven't used it before, but I think I can learn it quickly. Cesar told me that I could develop my program with the tools that I normally use to develop my projects.

The project consists of an element (image in its initial state). I use CSS to give the Zoom effect when the user positions the cursor on the image (hover) , as well as show the lower element (bar with buttons and description). When we press any button, a javascript function is executed that displays a message on the screen about which button was pressed. When the more information button is pressed, a modal will open where the required mock is displayed.

To run this code you you would need:

1. run your local server environment.
2. execute the project in a browser.


Thank you for your time.
